# JoyKey

JoyKey is a joystick-based keyboard designed for small, touch-screen devices.

## Instructions
- **Typing a letter** requires two gestures:
    1. Swipe the joystick toward the direction of the region containing desired letters to select. You can also tap in the area of the joystick nearest that region to select it.
    2. Swipe/tap the joystick again to select a letter
        - Tapping the center of the joystick will cancel the selection and bring you back to the home keyboard
- The last letter can be **deleted** using the top-left region
    - Holding the joystick in this direction will allow you to delete multiple characters

## Results

- We had 4 participants test the keyboard. After 15 minutes of use they reached an average typing speed of ~10 WPM.

## Dependencies
- The joystick UI is implemented using [Nipple.js](https://github.com/yoannmoinet/nipplejs)
